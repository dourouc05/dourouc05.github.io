## Discrete optimisation
Due to my teaching-assistant role, I have developed an exercise book for the discrete optimisation course. It also contains a set of final answers and worked-out solutions, so that the book may readily be used in different contexts. It is [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/dourouc05/OptimisationTeachingKit) (under a CC-NC 4 license). 

## Robotics

As a teaching assistant, I had the opportunity to contribute to Renaud Detry's robotics courseware, [teaching robotics with a simulator](https://github.com/ULgRobotics/trs). My role has been to ease the first steps with MATLAB and the simulator, by splitting the main demonstration script into smaller units (work done with [Mathieu Baijot](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/micas/index.php/mathieu-baijot-cv)) and by creating videos showing the use of the simulator (they are being finalised).
