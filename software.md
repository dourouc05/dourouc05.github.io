I am the main developer of the following Julia packages, directly related to my research: 

* [CombinatorialBandits.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/CombinatorialBandits.jl): strategies for combinatorial bandits, both well-known policies and the ones I developed during my PhD
* [Seleroute.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/Seleroute.jl): routing algorithms for use in computer networks, with a special focus on uncertainty and fairness
* [IndustrialProcessFlexibilisation.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/IndustrialProcessFlexibilisation.jl): flexible operations of industrial plants
* [ReservoirManagement.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/ReservoirManagement.jl): long-term planning of water-reservoir operation

I co-developed the [RAL Python package](https://github.com/SAWassermann/RAL) for stream-based active learning.
