I am the main developer of the following Julia packages, directly related to my research: 

* [CombinatorialBandits.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/CombinatorialBandits.jl): strategies for combinatorial bandits, both well-known policies and the ones I developed during my PhD
* [Seleroute.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/Seleroute.jl): routing algorithms for use in computer networks, with a special focus on uncertainty and fairness
* [IndustrialProcessFlexibilisation.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/IndustrialProcessFlexibilisation.jl): flexible operations of industrial plants
* [ReservoirManagement.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/ReservoirManagement.jl): long-term planning of water-reservoir operation

I co-developed the [RAL Python package](https://github.com/SAWassermann/RAL) for stream-based active learning.

I developed or significantly contributed to the following Julia packages when working on the previous packages: 

* [NonsmoothOptim.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/NonsmoothOptim.jl) for nonsmooth optimisation, especially subgradient method and bundle method
* [Kombinator.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/Kombinator.jl) for combinatorial optimisation: exact and approximation algorithms and linear-programming formulations for several combinatorial problems
* Constraint programming: 
  * [ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl), providing a solver interface for constraint programming (an extension of [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl))
  * [JuCP.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/JuCP.jl), a modelling layer for constraint programming (an extension of [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl))
  * [CPLEXCP.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/CPLEXCP.jl), a solver wrapper for CPLEX CP Optimizer
* Mathematical programming: [MathOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl), [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl), [MathOptFormat.jl](https://github.com/odow/MathOptFormat.jl)
* Mathematical-optimisation solvers: [CPLEX.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/CPLEX.jl), [Gurobi.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/Gurobi.jl), [SCS.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl), [Xpress.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/Xpress.jl)
